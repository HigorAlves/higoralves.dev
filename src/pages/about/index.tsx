					<Text>
						Hey, I&apos;m Higor Alves, I started as a Developer back in 2015,
						working with C.
						<br />
						<br />
						Early on in my career I decided I wanted to be an expert. So I set
						my mind on mastering the world&apos;s most popular programming
						language. I spent countless hours writing JavaScript for the
						companies I worked for as well as in the evenings for open source
						and other side projects.
						<br />
						<br />
						When I&apos;m not programming, you can find me playing PS5,
						traveling and doing bbq!
