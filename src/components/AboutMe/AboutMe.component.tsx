				<Text>
					Hey, I&apos;m Higor Alves, I started as a Developer back in 2015,
					working with C.
					<br />
					<br />
					Early on in my career I decided I wanted to be an expert. So I set my
					mind on mastering the world&apos;s most popular programming language.
					I spent countless hours writing JavaScript for the companies I worked
					for as well as in the evenings for open source and other side
					projects.
					<br />
					<br />
					When I&apos;m not programming, you can find me playing PS5, traveling
					and doing bbq!
